## Create Countdown Job in Kubernetes

### Description

The Nautilus DevOps team is crafting jobs in the Kubernetes cluster. While they're developing actual scripts/commands, they're currently setting up templates and testing jobs with dummy commands. Please create a job template as per details given below:


Create a job named countdown-nautilus.

The spec template should be named countdown-nautilus (under metadata), and the container should be named container-countdown-nautilus

Utilize image fedora with latest tag (ensure to specify as fedora:latest), and set the restart policy to Never.

Execute the command sleep 5

Note: The kubectl utility on the jump-host has been configured to work with the Kubernetes cluster.

Step 1: Create the job manifest

```bash
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: countdown-nautilus
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: countdown-nautilus
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: container-countdown-nautilus
          image: fedora:latest
          command:
            - sleep
            - "5"
      restartPolicy: Never
```

Step 2: Apply the manifest file

```bash
kubectl apply -f job.yaml
```

Step 3: Verify

```bash
kubectl get jobs
```
You should see something similar
```bash
NAME                 COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
countdown-nautilus   1/1           ...        ...
```
